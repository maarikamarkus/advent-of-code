# Advent Of Code 🎄

This repo contains my attempts on the puzzles of [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

While I have joined several leaderboards, my main goal with participating is to improve my problem solving skills along with my skills in particular languages.

In 2021, my main goal was problem solving skills, for which I used Python as I felt it was easier to get going. I also attempted some days with Kotlin as I had recently found it, but gave up quickly due to many ongoing projects.

In 2022, my main goal is still problem solving skills, but equally important is to improve my Scala skills. Let's see how far I can get! 🧑‍🎄
